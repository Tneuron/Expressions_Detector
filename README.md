Built a facial expression detection model using YOLOv5 which identifies expressions such as Happy, Sad and Angry and it was trained on a custom-labeled dataset created with OpenCV and labelImg and was optimized using hyperparameter tuning (batch size, image size, epochs) with evaluation via Mean Average Precision (mAP). 
The modules YOLOv5 and labelImg were changed from submodules to normal files.
